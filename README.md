# Unnull

This library takes a value, and seperates the null and undefined into `None` and the rest into `Some`. It works like many javascript `Maybe` libraries, originally it was named `Maybi`, but after some careful thought, I decided to call it "Unnull" and rewrote some of the functionalities.

"None" does not run maps.

And no, it is not a monad.
